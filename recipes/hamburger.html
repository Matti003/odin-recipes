    <div><h3>Description</h3>
        A hamburger is a sandwich consisting of a cooked ground beef patty, typically served between two slices of bread or a bun. The patty is usually seasoned with salt, pepper, and other spices, and can be topped with a variety of condiments, such as lettuce, tomato, cheese, pickles, onions, mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Hamburger buns are usually round and soft, and can be toasted or left un-toasted. The hamburger is a widely popular fast food dish and a staple of American cuisine, and can be found in many restaurants, food trucks, and street vendors. There are many variations of the hamburger, including different types of meat, toppings, and buns, and some people even customize their hamburgers with unique and creative ingredients.
