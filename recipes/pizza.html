    <div><h3>Description</h3>
        pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, 
        tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.
